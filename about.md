Welcome!

I thought that I would try to present my Spanish II Unit IV project by responding to each essential question as a blog post.

Obviously, this project is in Spanish. However, Spanish is not my native language, so I apologize in advance for any lingual errors. Please contact me if you see an error (please and thank you!).

This site is built using the extremely easy static website and blog generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted 100% (no catch) for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code for this website is completely open(source) and lives at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/riyaadazad/spanish-cities-project).

I hope that you like this project as much as I have enjoyed creating it! If you are interested in learning more about me, I'd be honored if you visited my [personal website](https://riyaadazad.github.io/)!

Sincerely,

***Riyaad Azad***
